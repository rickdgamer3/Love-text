## Love-text<br>
You can grab this piece of code <code>(love.py)</code>, send it to your geeky crush and break the ice.<br>
- The code is fully standalone which means you don't need to any install module.<br>
- This code can be compiled in IDLE, VSCODE or in any other web based compiler.<br>

I highly hope, this helps. And if you liked my work, don't forget follow me on instagram @yours_sayantan<br>
